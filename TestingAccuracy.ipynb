    "**In order to use these functions, you need to have separate, labeled images that have the cracks outlined in black.** This notebook can be utilized to score the thresholded crack images against ground truth images that have had the cracks traced over. Here are steps on how to use the code below:\n",
    "1. Duplicate a folder of the segmented images (not yet thresholded)\n",
    "2. For images with the cracks, trace over the cracks in black with an image editing feature of your choice\n",
    "3. *Save in a .txt file the name of the pictures that you edited* - this will allow you to only test the accuracy of images with cracks since all the others without them are the same, edited or unedited.\n",
    "4. Load the paths of the labeled segemented images and the .txt file that contains the name of the pictures into the `loadLabeledImages`. Save this function to a dictionary.\n",
    "5. You can now load your dictionary from the step above and the dictionary of thresholded images into the `testImages` function and save them to a variable (i.e. `score`).\n",
    "6. It is suggested to get one value rather than the score for each image, to print out the mean value of the variable from the above step (i.e. `print(numpy.average(list(score.values()))`)"
